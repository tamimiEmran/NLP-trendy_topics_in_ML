# NLP-trendy_topics_in_ML
In this small project I'll process NIPS conference papers and uncover the trends in Machine Learning research.



Neural Information Processing Systems conference is a machine learning conference where huge number of research is published

from this conference, theres a dataset that contains papers published from 1987 until 2017. 
figueres and tables are not included in the dataset. 

I will analyse this dataset using NLP methods.
